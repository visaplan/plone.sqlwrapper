        =========================
        visaplan.plone.sqlwrapper
        =========================
        
        This package provides a simple generator for SQL statements,
        which are then executed by a Zope database adapter.
        
        It does not try to implement an object-relational mapper (ORM) but simply helps
        to create SQL statements.
        
        The purpose of this package is *not* to provide new functionality
        but to factor out existing functionality from an existing monolitic Zope product.
        Thus, it is more likely to lose functionality during further development
        (as parts of it will be forked out into their own packages,
        or some functionality may even become obsolete because there are better
        alternatives in standard Plone components).
        
        There might be some work still necessary to make this product useful for a
        broader audience; it is currently in use in our monolithic product resp. it's
        successors only.
